However, one sily human of that family used that spell for his own ends and vanished into thin air because of the curse of Etain. After that, Etain put that scroll into a box, sealed it off, and hid it somewhere in Teos.

There are many bodies of water in the Willieoseu district. The lakes and waterways have been providing nutrition not only to people, but also to the forest trees and creatures living in this district. But recently, I've been tracking some contaminants in the lakes, things we haven't seen before. As a result, the quality of our water has degraded dramatically. Even more evidence of this is found in some of the creatures that live right on the water's edge... they have become violent and act strangely. 

I intend to capture these warped creatures and collect some specimens. This way, I can figure out what has been contaminating the lake. Can you help me?

These days, we're in big trouble. That's because the ruin we are now investigating keeps getting damaged by Golems. At the time we started the investigation, this never happened. But a little while back, the Golems started becoming more violent. We thought this had happened because the ruin had been influenced by an unknown power, so we investigated that area. However, it turned out there was no connection between the two. In the end,, we have no choice but to guess something unidentified is changing the nature of golems.

There is one entity among the Golems which has a remarkable movement. We researchers decided to dub this entity 'Lordrock.' We're not sure whether this Lordrock is commanding other golems or not. I'm certain that, at the least, Lordrock is influencing other golems' movement considerably. I figure if we can get rid of Lordrock, the damage the golems cause to the ruins will diminish dramatically. I want you to take care of this.

Nature is a very valuable and benevolent existence, just like a mother who births all mankind into existence.

Harpies' fierce and sharp talons are unattentively scarring young trees and their feeble branches are broken by the stong flapping of the wings, and fall to the ground to be trampled relentlessly. Mother nature is suffering a wound that is not allowed ot heal. As we humans look upon them, our hearts are torn apart as well.

So as the senior of Silvaren, I, Sairaamil, am planning to express my gratitude to the person who captures Manurna, the leader of the harpies living in the Willieoseu forest, and cuts off her head.

This is a huge affront to not only to the trees themsElves, but also all the people and animals who love and depend on the forest.

The ruler of the golems is an atrocious golem called Doraphos. Doraphos is no doubt a very dangerous being because it has over two times the bulk and power of other golems.

As you may have heard, offense is the best defense. Now that we know the Orcs' plan in advance, I think we have to dispose of this Orc called Cruel in order to prevent this battle from breaking out. Traveler, this is the most important and dangerous favor, and the last I will ask. Please sneak into the very depth of the Maitreyan Orc Base, and dispose of Cruel, then cut off his head and bring it to me.

I know there were a couple of peculiar pixies among them, but attacking travelers passing by in groups was a very rare occurrence. However, recently, this kind of accident has been growing in frequency.

It is my conjecture, but it is likely there is a certain pixie exercising her considerable influence over all the pixies living in the Eldain Woods and driving them to hatred against humans.

It is the dimensional gate he used to come to Teos from another world.
Sunting Manaburn instantly destroyed the Elven force that existed in the Borderland, and the fight against the God of another world dragged on for over 100 years.
Everyone was drinking from the bitter cup of imminent defeat.
At that time when the world seemed as though it was about to come to an end, what saved us was a unparalleled hero named Spinterr Vios. With abilities that were unimaginably magnificent, perhaps even above mortals, he banished the Dianoia family to Cornwell's Ruin and cut off the head of the God of another world, sealing him off in the rift from whence he came. I came to know this after he died and went to Atsilut's side, but Spinterr Vios was the incarnation of hero god, Dayfly.

After he sealed off Sunting Manaburn, nothing has happened to Aquilus Tor for a long time, as though that place was being protected by magic... However, a while ago, suspicious forces were discovered nearby.

We couldn't figure out a lot because it was only what the low class soldiers were carrying, but we were able to figure out the reason why they won't move easily.
That was because a commander of the Hecates Force, ranger Brakea Aulscream, is currently fulfilling a urgent mission and isn't in the base.
They couldn't move because their commander was not in position, even though there was a small Watch Tower they could easily take right in front of them. Heh heh, a situation like this might be idle time for them, but to us, it's a golden opportunity, don't you think?

The problem isn't simply that the Sealakels are increasing in number, it's that the temperment of these multiplying Sealakels is considerably more violent than before.
Because of this, innocent belivers who came to the Temple for prayer have been taken by surpise and injured, and frequently lost their lives, too. This is a really big deal!
As far as I know, Sealakel is a little wild, but they are creatures who never harm people.

As I proceeded to research the essenses we obtained before, I was able to figure out a number of things. The results supported my hypotheses exactly.
The mutated creatures turned out to be failures of a secret weapon production project Genetick Black Magic Lab is undertaking.
Discovering these failed mutations far and wide across the continent probably means their research is now spreading out to a much greater extent. 
Plagma must certainly be conspiring with the Senator in some fashion, with these weapons he made by himself. If we didn't notice this, we would've been deeply in trouble, but we'll trample them down now that we've found out this secret.",I'm looking for a way to raise the morale of the entire army.

Then, I'll get right to the point.

This is my guess based on my observation of the scale of their armed forces, but I'm thinking these forces are meant to proceed to the Adeurian district for the purpose of engaging in all-out war.
The commander-in-chief of the Futesys Force is David Boreanaz, a human and a royal knight.
I was told he gained several great victories against the Vail army in the Borderland district.
I wondered why, with such a great commander, they hadn't already attempted to attack us...
As it turns out, David was taken ill with a fever a while ago. That's why he did't come to the front. There are no commanders in the Futesys Force whatsoever, except this commander-in-chief, so this means they're like a tiger without teeth now.

I figure this is a golden opportunity to reduce the size of their armed forces.

In the meantime, I have tried to figure out the identity of a substantial commander of the Spinterr Resistance. I've had a hard time because those shrewd elves purposely tried to throw us off by putting up three or four fake commanders.
In addition, no matter how many we kill, they seem to keep replenishing their number - it's really bothersome.
I came to consider this possibility because they're in a cooperative relationship with the Futesys Force, as mentioned in the letter you brought last time.

I guess this is all thanks to your earnest and sincere help with the requests you take on.

There is an ancient ruin called Aurizen south of the village.
I don't know exactly how this place has been made use of.
Given that the Hellteeth occupied that area and didn't give up it, there must be some kind of superb power inside there, and I guess they are trying to use it.
It's very obvious considering all creatures near the ruin are receiving the orders of the Hellteeth. Among them, one exception is a dangerous viper.

Vipers have great self-respect, so they won't become a someone's servant carelessly. However, they are now controlled by the order of the Hellteeth.
Therefore, I suppose once we examine some vipers, we might obtain a clue about this inexplicable mind-control. My request is to bring me what you obtain from the Viper Summoner.
Vipers are atrocious enemies in combat, but maybe with your skill, you'll have an easier time with them. I'll be waiting, so if you get something, bring it back to me.","Welcome to Prymates village.

I'm giving you this advice because I don't want you to make the same mistakes I've made. Don't think my words too presumptuous.

I think it's safe to say that as Gawain Primer is to the Stardust Knights, so was Darkys Eizman to the Royal Knights.

It was truly absurd that he was banished from the Royal Knights by such a ridiculous false incrimination, and from his brother no less.
However, he didn't do anything about his brother's false incrimination.
He just said it was his own fault because he couldn't protect his honor.

But that doesn't mean we can forget our original duty. The real objective of rangers is protecting people from the threats and intimidation of others, rather than killing or destroying people.

You look to be curious about Cornwell's Ruins here. I know this place well. I wander the area trying to inform everyone who passes through here about the dangers this place once held. You see, Cornwell's Ruin is an ancient prison that was built after the war between the Dianoia family and the Elves more than a thousand years ago. This place stood long before humans ever appeared on this continent.

The Dianoia family were monsters made by an unknown being called St. Evil Spirit. Their abilities seemd to rival even those of the Elves. After they first appeared in this world, the Elves began losing their powers as nature was being destroyed all around them. The Elves' last stand was in Cornwell Forest, where they drove the Dianoia into a cave located at the corner of the forest and sealed them in for all time.

The cave remained sealed for over a thousand years, but in the end, the power of time was greater than the seal placed on the cave. The evil that was locked inside began seeping into the surrounding countryside and raising the long-dead warriors within the ruins.

{c5}(The old man begins to ramble on about names and places you think you may have heard about as a child. Hours seem to go by. You begin to understand why the guard dislikes this old man.){/c}

Am I boring you?! You do know that those who do not remember their history are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past, right? Well, seeing as how you're so easily bored, how about you go on a mission for me? I need to collect some evidence to show those thick-headed guards so they can see that the evil has escaped from the cavern and is now here in the ruins.","What's the matter? Are you afraid to enter the ruins? What are you, a chicken? CHICKEN! CHICKEN SCAREDY PANTS! SCAREDY CHICKEN FRAIDY PANTS! GET IN THERE YA BIG WUSS!","Oh come on! It's just a swarm of undead minions jailed for centuries, now raised from the dead seeking carnage and death for every living thing in Teos...  Don't be a wuss now, y'hear!",Wow! You're alive! Did you kill them? Excellent. Now we can prove that Cornwell's Ruin must be sealed for the sake of everyone's safety.

He was created by the Dianoia family a long time ago. It took a great evil to summon this beast. Many of the family of Dianoia were sacrificed for the blood ritual, and even more were killed by the beast himself.

A while back, my master entered Cornwell's Ruin in search of this beast. He had heard that it still wandered the dungeons deep in the ruins. A week after he entered the ruins, some travelers found him dead on the path near here... A sanguine trail of twisted flesh and intestines led all the way back to the entrance of the ruins. Clutched in his left hand was this small diary - the one I'm holding now.

This is the real reason why I tricked you into coming here. I'm asking for your help - begging, even. I want you to avenge my master in the name of this feeble Elf. 

Now, according to his diary, the Devil has a skull-like head and hides deep within the Temple of Cornwell's Ruin. It wields an enormous sword that can cleave through any metal, and is cloaked with a long cape enchanted with magical powers. While roaming the halls, he has the ability to walk unseen. He has great spiritual energy allowing him to smash even the most powerful foes, and he is followed by minions who obey his every command. 

Now, I know I may look frail to you, traveler, but in the many years I've spent here, I have accumulated many Lapis gems - some very powerful. These are priceless treasures, and I will gladly give them to you if you do this for me. ","If you see this Devil, tell me what he looks like.

The tale of the Argilla Ruin is one of them. Young folk like you and Kaise are all curious about the history of the Vail, so I can understand that feeling you get when you visit there. But despite those feelings, the ruin is far too dangerous to be freely explored.

When I was young, I went to that ruin and saw ancient writing on a wall. That ancient writing included stories about some sort of creatures trapped under a curse within the walls of the ruin. I couldn't decipher all of the text, but it seems that the Vail used to channel spirits in that temple when it was still standing. They would use these spirits to manifest great power and even use them as weapons against their enemies.

No Vail dares go to that place to channel spirits any longer, and that's mainly because of two enormous monsters who dwell within. I don't know how they came into existence, but those monsters are securing the ruin's underground first floor and second floor. They keep the evil spirits from passing on and finding rest, and they also prevent us from studying the spirits.

In my case, I succeeded my father's research about the evil spirit, so we've basically been researching this issue for two generations.

Long ago, in the age when we were able to control evil spirits very smoothly, I was told people used to contact creatures from another world, using those evil spirits. After the clan of humans appeared in Teos, the war has continued on, so from that moment, people have been researching about things that have more direct application in war, like this alchemy, rather than the evil spirits. That's why you see fewer scholars like me these days.

However, a little while ago, we realized that we can do somthing with that evil spirit. The problem is, our research is difficult to carry out because we can't obtain those evil spirits anywhere.

It has been 1000 years since their king, Ankylul WildDark, was defeated by the Elves in the Storm War, and he sneaked into the depths of Maitreyan.

I have a younger brother named Dear. We're not related by blood, but he is the last remaining 'family' I have, and I care about him. Due to the war, he lost his memory. I took him in and taught him how to make defense items to let him make a living by himself.

He's still pretty shy around people, but I feel relieved because he became a lot brighter than before. However, these days...I'm very worried that the harpies near the refinery have greatly increased in number. That boy is really scared of Harpies. He can't even sleep when he hears the harpies' cries - he'll often have nightmares from the sounds alone. I feel so sorry for him. Could I ask you to take out some of those harpies? Their number is too large for me to think about handling by myself.","The harpies are slowly decreasing in number. Please, work as hard as you can.","The harpies are slowly decreasing in number.

I'm the leader of the Stardust Knights, Sherlock Spencer. Word reached me of your heroic actions in Silvaren, and I'd like to pay my respect to you on behalf of the soldiers of the Alliance of Light.

However, currently, the spear-rattling of the Orcs is becoming harder and harder to ignore. The Orcs becoming an active military power would be a very serious problem in the midst of the war against the Union of Fury. The King, William Typhon, ordered us to stop the Orcs from becoming any more powerful.

However, in this situation, we can't pull knights from the forefront of the war to take care of threats at our back. And that's when I recalled what you'd accomplished before. If you can help us in this moment of difficulty, we'll recognize you as an honorary member of the Stardust Knights in the name of His Majesty the King. A royal gift awaits you at the successful completion of this mission too.

But anyway, let me get back to business. There is a powerful group of orcs called the WarEdge Clan that roams in both the west and east of the Adellia district.
The messenger sent from Maitreyan hasn't reached them yet; at this point, we're lucky they've yet to form an alliance with the Orcs in Maitreyan. Before they respond to Maitreyan's offer of alliance, we have to cause them damage so massive that they are incapable of cementing an alliance. First, I'd like you to destroy the WarEdge clan near the Arvea Feller's Town in the east of the district. More specifically, you have to get rid of 15 WarEdge Orc Legionary Soldiers and 7 WarEdge Orc Squad Leaders, then deliver a report to Ensiferr.

If you're reading this letter, it means you've completed the first mission. You've really got some talent, I must admit. However, remember that this is just the beginning.

I recommend that you join others who seek to accomplish the same ends. The Elves in league with the Royal Knights are also doing what they can to stop the WarEdge Orcs from joining with Maitreyan. I'm sure there are others out there who are also working toward this goal, so keep that in mind.

Now, go to the WarEdge Clan village located to the west of Huigronn Stronghold. You have to get rid of 15 Orc Warriors and the clan's chief, Kiba-Tul, then report to Ensiferr.

We Humans don't know all that much about the history of Teos Epeiros as it was before the more modern times.

Currently, Ankylul WildDark, the King of the Orcs and a very powerful warrior-magician, is being revived in Maitreyan. The Elves sustained considerable damage in their last war against the Orcs.

The Elves suspect that Ankylul hasn't regained all his power yet. In order to get rid of him, there are other problems we need to address first. First, I'd like you to meet with Mulus Toreo in Aelbeageu and deliver this letter to him. Use the portal to Keolloseu here in Apulune to cut most of the distance off your journey.

As you may have surmised, normal methods won't be effective for getting rid of Ankylul WildDark, the King of the Orcs. Ankylul is a descendant of Oak, one of the Telaiosis who existed before even we Elves came into being long ago.

I'm a leader of Royal Knights, Lectis Eizman.
The heroic deeds you performed in Silvaren raised the reputation of Humans in the eyes of our Elven allies. On behalf of His Majesty, the King of glorious Apulune, let me be the first to acknowledge the bravery you've shown thus far.

However, currently, the spear-rattling of the Orcs is becoming harder and harder to ignore. The Orcs becoming an active military power would be a very serious problem in the midst of the war against the Union of Fury. The King, William Typhon, ordered us to stop the Orcs from becoming any more powerful.

However, I can safely say there are no knights here to fight against the Orcs, except the knights assigned to guard Apulune - at the moment, every knight we can spare has been sent to the forefront of combat.

If you can help us in this moment of difficulty, we'll recommend you for recognition as an honorary member of the Royal Knights in the name of His Majesty the King. A royal gift awaits you at the successful completion of this mission too.

But anyway, let me get back to business. There is a powerful group of orcs called the WarEdge Clan that roams in both the west and east of the Adellia district.
The messenger sent from Maitreyan hasn't reached them yet; at this point, we're lucky they've yet to form an alliance with the Orcs in Maitreyan. Before they respond to Maitreyan's offer of alliance, we have to cause them damage so massive that they are incapable of cementing an alliance. First, I'd like you to destroy the WarEdge clan near the Arvea Feller's Town in the east of the district. More specifically, you have to get rid of 15 WarEdge Orc Legionary Soldiers and 7 WarEdge Orc Squad Leaders, then deliver a report to Echion.

Now, you need to stop the WarEdge clan in the west of Adellia from joining the Maitreyan force. I was told the WarEdge Clan Orcs in the west are stronger than Orcs in the east. I recommend that you join others who seek to accomplish the same ends. The Elves who are in league with the Royal Knights are also doing their best to stop the Orcs from joining forces with the Maitreyan stronghold. I'm sure there are others out there who are also working toward this goal, so keep that in mind.

Now, go to the WarEdge Clan village located to the west of Huigronn Stronghold. You have to get rid of 15 Orc Warriors and the clan's chief, Kiba-Tul, then report to Echion. After that, further information will await you.

I'm Lana Fairwind, of the Deities Religion. The lesson of Etain's guidance you displayed in Silvaren set an excellent example for many brothers and sisters of our religion.

We Humans don't know all that much about the history of Teos Epeiros as it was before the more modern times.

As you may have surmised, normal methods won't be effective for getting rid of Ankylul WildDark, the King of the Orcs. Ankylul is a descendant of Oak, one of the Telaiosis who existed before even we Elves came into being long ago. The result of our ancestors' sin are the cursed and depraved beings we know today as Orcs. This is why their ruler, Ankylul, has a small portion of the power of the Telaiosis, and why they bear us such enmity. 

We sustained great losses in the past trying to take down Ankylul. At this time, Ankylul hasn't recovered his full power, nor has he roused the Orc clans scattered throughout this land and bound them into a great army. If we don't get rid of him now, it will only become more and more unlikely we'll have a clear shot. I can give you the chance, by make a powerful magical nostrum that will allow you to stand against Ankylul.

I'm Kilian Fireone, a magician belonging to MystrasEyes, as well as the Archmage of the Windwalker Magician's Guild. On behalf of the Alliance of Light, let me thank you for your brave actions in Silvaren.

However, currently, the spear-rattling of the Orcs is becoming harder and harder to ignore. The Orcs gathing military strength is a very serious problem in the midst of this war against the Union of Fury. 
We Elves have no wish to experience the same bloodshed that we did during the past war against the Orcs, nor do we have the manpower in reserve to fight a war on another front in the midst of this great campaign against the Union of Fury.

But anyway, let me get back to the subject at hand. There is a powerful group of orcs called the WarEdge Clan that roams in both the west and east of the Adellia district.
The messenger sent from Maitreyan hasn't reached them yet; at this point, we're lucky they've yet to form an alliance with the Orcs in Maitreyan. Before they respond to Maitreyan's offer of alliance, we have to cause them damage so massive that they are incapable of cementing an alliance. First, I'd like you to destroy the WarEdge clan near the Arvea Feller's Town in the east of the district. More specifically, you have to get rid of 15 WarEdge Orc Legionary Soldiers and 7 WarEdge Orc Squad Leaders, then deliver a report to Ignifer.

If you're reading this letter, it means you've completed the first mission. Looks like you've definitely got some abilities above the ordinary. But keep in mind that this is just the beginning.

Now, you need to stop the WarEdge clan in the west of Adellia from joining the Maitreyan force. It seems that the WarEdge Clan Orcs in the west are stronger than Orcs in the east, so I recommend that you join others who seek to accomplish the same ends. The Humans who have allied with us are also doing what they can to stop the WarEdge Orcs from joining with Maitreyan. I'm sure there are others out there who are also working toward this goal, so keep that in mind.

Now, go to the WarEdge Clan village located to the west of Huigronn Stronghold. You have to get rid of 15 Orc Warriors and the clan's chief, Kiba-Tul, then report to Ignifer.

As you may have surmised, normal methods won't be effective for getting rid of Ankylul WildDark, the King of the Orcs. Ankylul is a descendant of Oak, one of the Telaiosis who existed before even we Elves came into being long ago. The result of our ancestors' sin are the cursed and depraved beings we know today as Orcs. This is why their ruler, Ankylul, has a small portion of the power of the Telaiosis, and why they bear us such enmity. 

We sustained great losses in the past trying to take down Ankylul. At this time, Ankylul hasn't recovered his full power, nor has he roused the Orc clans scattered throughout this land and bound them into a great army. If we don't get rid of him now, it will only become more and more unlikely we'll have a clear shot. I can give you the chance, by make a powerful magical nostrum that will allow you to stand against Ankylul. I'll need you to bring me the materials, though, and I'm telling you beforehand, it's quite a bit.

In order to defeat him, there are things we must arrange in advance to give us the best possible margin for success. First, seek out Mulus Toreo in Aelbeageu and hear what wisdom he has to impart.

As you may have surmised, normal methods won't be effective for getting rid of Ankylul WildDark, the King of the Orcs. Ankylul is a descendant of Oak, one of the Telaiosis who existed before even we Elves came into being long ago. The result of our ancestors' sin are the cursed and depraved beings we know today as Orcs. This is why their ruler, Ankylul, has a small portion of the power of the Telaiosis, and why they bear us such enmity. 

We sustained great losses in the past trying to take down Ankylul. At this time, Ankylul hasn't recovered his full power, nor has he roused the Orc clans scattered throughout this land and bound them into a great army. If we don't get rid of him now, it will only become more and more unlikely we'll have a clear shot. I can give you the chance, by make a powerful magical nostrum that will allow you to stand against Ankylul. I'll need you to bring me the materials, though, and I'm telling you beforehand, it's quite a bit.

First, bring me 99 Rilans, 30 Spirit Cores, and 20 Adamars Stones. You can buy these materials from shops, or you can obtain them from many monsters out there as well.

As you may have surmised, normal methods won't be effective for getting rid of Ankylul WildDark, the King of the Orcs. Ankylul is a descendant of Oak, one of the Telaiosis who existed before even we Elves came into being long ago. The result of our ancestors' sin are the cursed and depraved beings we know today as Orcs. This is why their ruler, Ankylul, has a small portion of the power of the Telaiosis, and why they bear us such enmity. 

We sustained great losses in the past trying to take down Ankylul. At this time, Ankylul hasn't recovered his full power, nor has he roused the Orc clans scattered throughout this land and bound them into a great army. If we don't get rid of him now, it will only become more and more unlikely we'll have a clear shot. I can give you the chance, by make a powerful magical nostrum that will allow you to stand against Ankylul.

Up until relatively recently, it was overrun by devils from another dimension - can you believe it? Apparently, they had been the denizens of that place for a long time. Originally, Acre was one of the high priests in charge of managing the Aidion Neckria. In fact, Acre was the very person who first discovered that the Aidion Neckria was occupied by devils from another dimension. However, Acre didn't report the devils he discovered to the Senator. Avarice had blinded his good sensibilities - he must've thought he could take advantage of these devils' power.

However, these devils from another dimension were not beings that would be so easily controlled. One of them took advantage of Acre until he regained the power he lost when he entered this dimension. Once this devil regained his power, he betrayed Acre, and instantly Aidion Neckria was turned into the scene of a massacre.

Acre became afraid that his transgression would be uncovered, and he escaped in the chaos, but as you can see, he paid the ultimate price in the end.

Perhaps you already know of the Aidion Neckria, a place holy to the Vail?

Up until relatively recently, it was overrun by devils from another dimension - can you believe it? Apparently, they had been the denizens of that place for a long time. Originally, Acre was one of the high priests in charge of managing the Aidion Neckria. In fact, Acre was the very person who first discovered that the Aidion Neckria was occupied by devils from another dimension. However, Acre didn't report the devils he discovered to the Senator. Avarice had blinded his good sensibilities - he must've thought he could take advantage of these devils' power.

However, these devils from another dimension were not beings that would be so easily controlled. One of them took advantage of Acre until he regained the power he lost when he entered this dimension. Once this devil regained his power, he betrayed Acre, and instantly Aidion Neckria was turned into the scene of a massacre.

Acre became afraid that his transgression would be uncovered, and he escaped in the chaos, but as you can see, he paid the ultimate price in the end. However, we're now in a position where we have to work together with the Vail to deal with these devils. Take this letter to Panakeia Lab in Reikeuseu.

Perhaps you already know of the Aidion Neckria, a place holy to the Vail?

Up until relatively recently, it was overrun by devils from another dimension - can you believe it? Apparently, they had been the denizens of that place for a long time. Originally, Acre was one of the high priests in charge of managing the Aidion Neckria. In fact, Acre was the very person who first discovered that the Aidion Neckria was occupied by devils from another dimension. However, Acre didn't report the devils he discovered to the Senator. Avarice had blinded his good sensibilities - he must've thought he could take advantage of these devils' power.

However, these devils from another dimension were not beings that would be so easily controlled. One of them took advantage of Acre until he regained the power he lost when he entered this dimension. Once this devil regained his power, he betrayed Acre, and instantly Aidion Neckria was turned into the scene of a massacre.

Acre became afraid that his transgression would be uncovered, and he escaped in the chaos, but as you can see, he paid the ultimate price in the end. However, we're now in a position where we have to work together with the Vail to deal with these devils. Take this letter to Panakeia Lab in Reikeuseu.

Up until relatively recently, it was overrun by devils from another dimension - can you believe it? Apparently, they had been the denizens of that place for a long time. Originally, Acre was one of the high priests in charge of managing the Aidion Neckria. In fact, Acre was the very person who first discovered that the Aidion Neckria was occupied by devils from another dimension. However, Acre didn't report the devils he discovered to the Senator. Avarice had blinded his good sensibilities - he must've thought he could take advantage of these devils' power.

However, these devils from another dimension were not beings that would be so easily controlled. One of them took advantage of Acre until he regained the power he lost when he entered this dimension. Once this devil regained his power, he betrayed Acre, and instantly Aidion Neckria was turned into the scene of a massacre.

Acre became afraid that his transgression would be uncovered, and he escaped in the chaos, but as you can see, he paid the ultimate price in the end. However, the devil still dwells in Aidion Neckria. Take this letter to Panakeia Lab in Reikeuseu. If you give it to Arkus, he will help you prepare to do battle against this devil.

Telamon is a very kind person, but...sometimes he's too kind.
Even though rough things happen to him, he worries about them all alone because he doesn't want to trouble anyone else.
I think this situation is like that too.
For several days, he has been totally on pins and needles about something. I've tried to ask him about it, but he just talks to me like with a smile, saying 'I'm doing a-okay Rosage; it's nothing you need to bother yourself with.'
I know he doesn't want me to be worried about him, but...that just makes me want to help him out more!

If you find Telamon, talk to him confidently. Be like ""I'm so awesome that whatever it is you're having trouble with, just looking at it can solve it!"" Then, maybe he'll open up and talk to you.

I didn't believe it at first; I looked everywhere, but I couldn't find it. Just 10 days have passed, but I lost it already.... I need to find it before that customer comes to me again, or I'll really be in hot water.

I still remember it because the size of the bounty was so incredible.
There's something strange about all this, though...

Normally, if someone loses something, they try to let as many people as they can know about it, so that if anyone else finds out anything, they can let the owner know.
However, this woman seems to be very secretive in her searching.
The information we have available is very limited, and all we know is that the bounty attached is huge. It's the exact opposite of what someone sensible would do in this situation.

Ah...perhaps I've piqued your curiosity, so let me tell you a little more about this situation.
I was told that woman was cast out of a family of Vail aristocrats because she's actually a half-blood. Imagine that, eh?

That family must have placed a great value on the purity of their bloodline. It's rare that you hear of Vail disowning family. But really, it's that family who are the unlucky ones.
In the end, that woman's sadness turned into a grudge against them.
After much trial, she discovered a way to make a poison deadly only to Vail, using phials of Vail blood.

It's a sad story, but it fits my plan oh-so well!

I can't believe the statue itself disappeared! Just my luck...

There are a lot of man-eating animals living around Pandorashys where we're living. These days, more and more fighters who heard about this place are coming here, but accidents happens a lot. They have gone missing, and corpses and bones have been found rather frequently. The Union of Fury soldiers must have taken losses from these carnivorous beasts too, don't you think?

Last time, when we captured one man-eating wild boar and cut its stomach open, we found a handful of teeth inside. Right now, we've only got a few special products exclusive to Skulleron, so if we make ornaments with Nordeins' teeth and sell them, I guess we can make a good bit of money that way.

Did you witness the truth behind the HellTeeth and the spiritual energy that's been pouring out?

So...it wasn't just a rumor after all. If my expectation is correct, HellTeeth might also have a hierarchical society, and they might be coexisting with a number of species we hardly see in the more northern reaches of Teos Epeiros.

Judging by your look, you don't seem to be a normal traveler. Travelers have no reason to come here. At any rate, from the moment I saw you, I knew you were someone who could handle this job I've got. Are you interested in hearing a little more?

Ever since Iskiel led us to settle down here, Faila has felt strangely anxious due to the constant energy emanating from the Mirr'os Hills. That's an excessively dangerous place, and fierce have often been seen roaming around there, so people seldom venture down that way.

The problem is, the most important area for mining the ore called the elementalium that we can only get in Skulleron is the Mirr'os Hills. Maybe those Union of Fury fiends were familiar with these monsters, but now that we Alliance of Light folks have settled down, these HellTeeth monsters seem a lot more organized than we first thought.

Faila seems to feel disconcerted by these HellTeeth. She's already devoted her full concentration to purifying the energy of the district - a kind we're unfamiliar with. Not until we uncover the reality of the HellTeeth will she be able to relax.

Can you head out to Mirr'os? I'd like you to cut down the number of Golems and HellTooth Parasites in that area. If I tell Faila what you're doing, it's likely that I'll be able to help Faila get her mind back under control.

You should know that the Mirr'os area is a very important place that serves as a supply route for the transportation of war materials.

We haven't expelled the surviving forces of the Union of Fury, and we're just sitting back and taking their provocations without doing anything. I needn't say that this shouldn't go on, but Iskiel just regards them as an insignificant force, choosing to focus his attention elsewhere.

This time, they are more powerful, completely different from the Elven warriors we're familiar with. Since we've flushed out the leaders, that means this is a golden opportunity to sweep the Elves from Endia district once and for all, doesn't it? Of course, I'm sure you're already well aware of this.

It might take a while for reinforcements to arrive, so this time, you ARE the reinforcements!

In order for our still-weak force to win the battle against the Elves, we need to gather more great heroes like yourself.
Fortunately for us, it's clear that the Alliance of Light's troops look very puzzled due to our sudden attack against their rear.

It also appears that those who have tasted the power of Crowley are sending most of their Rangers to keep themselves informed.

Rice is such a common crop that it's widely used by both the Alliance of Light and the Union of Fury as an important staple food. Plain Rice, see, is like the Alliance of Light - one may take Humans or Elves for granted, but they go so well with everything that it's hard not to like them. Sticky Rice is like the Union of Fury - somewhat more exotic, but because of their 'stickiness,' they sometimes get into sticky situations with each other. So you see, even in food, there is the metaphor of distinct cultures!

Our ancestors began a harvest festival in which it was customary to thank the Goddess for the year's harvest, and to share the bounty of the fields with others as a way of inviting the Goddess to bless next year's harvest as well. In this festival, it's customary to throw a handful of plain rice on the campfire as an offering to the Goddess, and as the rice is consumed by the flames, it will carry a wish of yours to the Goddess as well.",,Plain rice is distinguished according to the stickiness and the proportion of starch content.

I never expected I'd see you folks in Skulleron, but we've been carrying out the operation to attack the rear of the Alliance of Light stealthily, from our base in Skulleron here.
As a basic step for the rear attack, it was a natural recourse for us to learn your language.

After master Browceun left here by General Amaras's order, several of us remained to conduct much deeper research into the hidden effects of Crowley...

Then, the Alliance of Light hit with a sudden attack, forcing us to discard all our research material on the quick, lest it be discovered. However, the problem was, we had to quickly dispose of animals we had painstakingly raised for the purpose of our research.

In the middle of our research with Sir Browceun, we implemented one small experiment in the Mirr'os Hills area. It was an experiment on a humanoid monster, rather than an animal sort, like the others.

The subject of our experiments? Trolls!

Unlike with the animals we raised, we sprinkled a portion of Crowley small enough that no one would notice among these humanoid monsters, in their natural habitat. 
As a result, we realized that Trolls hold Blue Pieces of Lapis inside their bodies.

Isn't that interesting? A Blue Piece of Lapis from a human type... I'd like you to collect those pieces and bring them to me. Let's find out what shape these Blue Piece of Lapis will take.

My hometown, Adellia, is a border area the Alliance of Light must pass through in order to go to the D-Water Borderland. A dreadful wind howling over ochre hills and plains - that's Adellia for you.
It has been too long since I went back to the homeland, so my memory's a little rusty. Why, you ask? I'm a geologist, so I travel all over, helping develop mines in new areas.
That's why I'm versed in lots of languages. I pick up new tongues here and there, you know...I even understand the language of the Union of Fury, as you can hear for yourself.

It's probably because of those toxic chemicals you guys sprayed out everywhere.

Have you grown in wisdom and power since we last met?

Last time, as a result of reviewing the Starfumos Invasion Plan you delivered, 

we found some unexpected information.

We realized there is an allied union forming, as part of an invasion plan of the Silverpick Goblins!

I hadn't noticed it before, since it was written in an encrypted form in the plans.

But recently, our cryptologists deciphered the code, and we found out all about their union.

The person guiding the whole process was none other than Talund DemonStone.

I assume you might already know the situation very well, but according to the invasion plan, I expect DemonStone's forces might be a tough nut to crack.

However, more importantly, we discovered the fact Talund replied to a backup request previously sent out by the Goblins.

We have to intercept this news before it is delivered to the Goblins' leader, Ballakashi.

Thus, your mission is to find a Silverpick Goblin Spirit carrying out the mission to deliver Talune's reply to Ballakashi and steal Talund's Letter.

About two or three Silverpick Goblin Spirits are grouped together - only one is the real spirit; the other two spirits are just fakes.

The real spirit is carrying documents, each of which contains important information, and the other two spirits are there to assist the real spirit in case of an emergency.

The core of this mission is to see through the illusion and fine which one is the real spirit, then recover Talund's Letter from this real spirit as soon as you're able.

I've got a new mission for you as soon as this one is over, too. I hope you keep in mind that this mission is a really crucial mission for the peace of both the Keuraijen district as well as the Starfumos district.

Here's the lay of things: I asked some of the villagers to do a couple things to prepare to make a piece of armor for me. However, there was something I needed to take care of, so I've put it off. All you need to do is run this series of errands in my place.

It should prove too difficult. If you give this {c3}Moneybag{/c} to {c2}Norman Diero{/c} in the east of the village, he'll give you some material that armor can be crafted from.

If your inventory is full or you want to store something important, you can store it in the warehouse. However, remember that if you retrieve an item, you have to pay 5% commission as a storage fee. 
Also, the number of warehouses you can use is limited, but if you use the Item Mall expansion, you can use up to 6 warehouses in total, so keep that in mind. Next, know that you can give or receive items you own between characters because this warehouse is shared between all the characters on one account.

I made a strong iron plate, so it should be smooth and unpiercable, but it's gotta be finished first. Ask a {c2}Mano{/c} the armor artisan to give this piece the finishing touch. He's without a doubt the best in this village when it comes to skill in making defensive gear. Say...this is your first journey, right? Now that {c2}Batan Animus{/c} let you run an errand, I'll teach ya how to use the forge, so listen up.

Every time you fight with your weapons and armor, their durability decreases bit by bit. Once the durability of weapon reaches zero, you can't attack easily, and once the durability of armor reaches zero, you'll start taking more damage. That's why you've gotta keep them in good repair to use them properly.

If you want to fix your gear, all you have to do is find a blacksmith like me in any village. After you speak to them, if you click ""repair weapon,"" a ""forge"" window will appear. They'll explain anything you might not understand, I suppose. According to their explanation, just click the equipment you want to fix. If you feel it's bothersome to fix them one by one and want to fix all your equipment together at once, just click ""Repair All."" The cost is indicated before the the repairs, so you'll always know what you're gettin' into before you spend a single cent - always helpful, right?

Then, can you see ""Lapis Fusion""? You might wonder what a Lapis is. According to the legends, Lapises are mysterious stones also known as the ""Goddess's Tears."" Each Lapis has a different ability, so they're used to reinforce all sorts of equipment. But it doesn't mean you can combine every piece of equipment with a lapis. Lapis fusion is possible from Noble-class equipment onward, so you're better off not wasting your time with attaching lapises to low-level equipment.

Well, anyway, fusing lapises is a blacksmith's job. Similar to weapon repairs, if you speak to a blacksmith and choose ""repair weapon,"" you will see a ""forge"" window, right? This time, you'd select the ""lapis fusion"" option. Then you'll see a window where you can fuse a lapis with a piece of equipment, or extract a fused lapis from a piece of equipment.

""Fusion object"" is where you put the equipment you can fuse a lapis with, and ""Fusion item"" is where you put a lapis you'll fuse to equipment. However, you can only put equipment here if it's not currently equipped on you. And remember that a fusion attempt doesn't always result in success. Each fusion has a certain probability of occurring, so the process can end in either success or failure. If you fail the fusion attempt, the lapis will be broken. It's a calculated risk, but the lapis will make you much stronger, so I think you'll find it useful! 

Now, you should stop by {c2}Mano{/c]'s place before you go back to Batan - Mano's really capable armor artisan. I'll bet {c2}Batan Animus{/c} has something else to ask you again, too.

There are many organizations in the capital such as a Palace containing the Humans' royalty, the Elven Embassy, the Mage Guild, the Stardust Knights, the Merchant Guild, the Apulune Port, and many places where you can buy and sell items you might be in need of, always open in Apulune Square.

This time, you'd select the ""lapis fusion"" option. Then you'll see a window where you can fuse a lapis with a piece of equipment, or extract a fused lapis from a piece of equipment.

""Fusion object"" is where you put the equipment you can fuse a lapis with, and ""Fusion item"" is where you put a lapis you'll fuse to equipment. However, you can only put equipment here if it's not currently equipped on you. And remember that a fusion attempt doesn't always result in success. Each fusion has a certain probability of occurring, so the process can end in either success or failure. If you fail the fusion attempt, the lapis will be broken. It's a calculated risk, but the lapis will make you much stronger, so it's a gamble that's worth a try, heh heh!

Well, that's pretty useful to know, isn't it? newcomer? Anyway..Please tell Lia Kreis she doesn't have to feel bad about the letter. I'm just satisfied to know my friend is still alive.

Anyway, this is what Lia Kreis requested, but well...I'm so busy these days that askin' me to repeat myself is just a no-go, so listen up!

I'm a warehouse keeper - super important job, y'know. If your inventory is full or 
you want to store important things, you can store them in a warehouse. However, if you want to retreive an item, you have to pay a 5% commission. Don't think of it as expensive; warehouse keepers need to make a living too.

At first, the amount of warehouse space you can use will be limited, but if you purchase additional space from the item mall, you can greatly expand your warehouse space - keep that in mind. Also, since warehouse space is shared between all your characters on one account, all your characters can access the things you've stored within it!
However, you can't store money here - this is no bank, after all. Warehouses are meant for storing items, weapons, and armor only.

I'm glad to see you've paid close attention - I pray your mind be as quick in all things! Anyway, Lia is certainly devoted. I can't believe she's cooking every month for someone she's not even sure will come back. Well...I just realized you probably have no idea what I'm talking about since you're new around here, right? I'd like to tell you, but...as you can see, I'm terribly busy. Please give this food materials box to Kaff, the cook. He's very talkative, but he's a pretty damn good cook all the same. You can trust him. Well then, I'm counting on you!",,What are you still doing here? Lazy folk never rise to the top!,

I'd buy a poster if she was on it~

Actually, there was a friend {c2}Lia Kreis{/c} had been hanging out with since she was young. But eventually, their friendship ratcheted up a notch and things started to get a bit steamy. The guy is a bit of a pipe-dreamer, though; he has all these ideas of being the greatest mage in the Union of Fury. His name is {c2}Nazek{/c}, the first-class magician . {c2}Lia{/c} makes tasty food with the best-grade ingredients once a month, and sends it to him. But his world is full of studying and he ends up skipping a lot of meals. That's why {c2}Lia Kreis{/c} is all alone, making her food with such dedication...

I do hope they'll eventually get married, and I know I'm not the only one who hopes so. But seriously? {c2}Nazek{/c} is a first-class idiot! I think he still thinks {c2}Lia Kreis{/c} is just a good friend. Blows my mind, it does!

I assume it will take some time to complete the food. Those high-grade ingredients do take a lot of care to prepare, after all. Oh...by the by, do you know how to open a private shop? Of course, you have no idea, do you? Excellent!
I shall impart this useful knowledge to you! If you look at the bottom of right side of the screen, you'll see the icon where you can open the inventory, status window, or etc. If you press an auxillary skill icon there, you can use a gesture or other commands you can utilize via hotkey or a single click. If you press the 'Private Shop' Icon near the bottom there, a window where you can put an item appears. If you put an item here, the item is registered to your private shop. After that, you input a price and a title of sign, you can open a private shop. It's so easy, isn't it? Oh...most importantly, you can only open private shops in the capital, so you'll want to keep that in mind when you're thinking of selling any of your wares.

Oops...did I talk your ear off again? Sorry, sorry; I get like that when I'm all caught up in cooking, you know!

Well, that's about all you need to know for now. But say, errand runner...I already packed this - you know what it is, right? Can you hand {c2}Lia Kreis{/c}'s passionate dishes to that dumbass who just studies all the time instead of paying attention to her?

You didn't come here to learn magic, but you brought some food? Ah...{c2}Lia Kreis{/c} definitely sent this. You've heard about me from the folks in the village, have you? I'm glad that they're concerned about my welfare, but this is more like...some sort of soap opera.

Anyway, as you know, {c2}Lia Kreis{/c} always prepares some food to send to me once a month. The folks in the village somehow got it in their heads that I don't think of {c2}Lia Kreis{/c} as anything more than a friend, but...to tell the truth, I've had the hots for Lia for YEARS. The reason for my actions being what they are is because I'm not sure when my studies in magic will be complete, and I don't want {c2}Lia{/c} to worry about me. I suppose that's how I must seem to everyone else. What others think doesn't bother me all that much, but...I feel bad about {c2}Lia{/c}, thinking about how I've acted with her.

Anyway, I'm supposed to give you some good information because you've come all the way to make a delivery for that chatterbox. Maybe that's how you came to meet {c2}Lia Kreis{/c} in the first place.

What I'm going to tell you is a story about the capital. I often venture to the capital frequently to study higher-level magic. Our capital, {c4}Iris{/c}, pretty much functions as the nerve center of the Union of Fury. Narsilian Hall is where the Senators conduct their daily work, including legislation and administration of justice, and all cases pertaining to the Vail are heard here. Also, the capital has the most active community, as well as special items and facilities you probably haven't seen in other villages or cities.

For example, there's a cape merchant, and a merchant selling a vehicle you can't find in other cities. Also, there's a smuggler around, so you can trade items and other things with those from the Alliance of Light. For reference, you'd better remember you can't fight with other forces there. And of course, you can't forget the underground stadium where you can fight enemies from the Alliance of Light in fair, judged matches. If you want to go to the smugglers' place and the underground stadium, just talk to the gate keeper. He'll let you go there once you can pony up the cost.

{c5}(He seems deeply distressed about something){/c} Okay! I've made up my mind! When my studies are over, I'm definitely gonna propose to {c2}Lia Kreis{/c}!
Hey, I know you've been having a hard time, always running errands, but...do you think you could do a little somethin' for me? This is a toy that {c2}Lia{/c} scrimped and saved to buy for me when she and I were young. I doubt she's ever thought that I'd still be treasuring it today, haha. Can you give this to her? Give it to her and tell her that when I return someday...I'll make her the happiest woman in the land!

You can select Hard Mode if you reach level 40 in normal mode. The required experience point needed per level is more than in normal mode. However, since you have 7 status points and 4 skill points to distribute, you can make a more enhanced character than what you can attain in Normal Mode.

It's also possible to use much stronger equipment than you could use in Normal Mode. You can figure this out from an item's title. Although you were able to use as far as Dread-class items in a Normal Mode, it is now possible for you use Legend-class items in Hard Mode.

The first research was done on inanimate objects; largely armors and tools. The experiment was nearly successful. We mixed certain amounts of medicine and succeeded in catalyzing a reaction never before seen! The treated items empowered their bearers and reacted well with gemstones called ""Lapis."" The production ratios were the biggest issue. Difficult production methods and formulae gave us a headache. The first successes, which helped the military's power, were welcomed, but the continual failures disappointed us. Thus, the subsidy payments were cut, and I and my friend {/c2}Saturn Crowa{/c} had to invest all we had. However, insufficient capital and a degraded level of testing brought failure and people started rejecting us. Finally, we ended up buying couple of armors and doing our own testing. However, {/c2}Saturn Crowa{/c}, who was tired of continually failing, finally gave up. I'm currently doing testing on the gloves. What will the outcome be? Perhaps this can become a new starting point for me...

The research was nearly successful. When {c2}Saturn Crowa{/c} left, I worked on it by myself. The experiment I performed on the glove after I wrote the first report was a success, and when I performed the process on the boots, they showed an interesting reaction, from which I should be able to extrapolate a greater conclusion. If I continue on this way, success will surely be mine. However, I don't know whether my body can take it. If I die here, no one would ever find out the results. Where would my experiment end up? I'll have to finish the experiments whle there is still life left in these bones.

Although I don't know how it's made, their medicine has ingredients similar to mine. Well, here is your mission: go get me some of that medicine. They give it out as a reward for helping them with their tasks. I hate having to do work for them just for some medicine, but for this experiment I have no other options.

I have taken the most precious and irreplaceable thing from a man... I know I won't be forgiven. I couldn't longer stay in one place after seeing that man enraged... I could not talk to anyone about it. I wanted forgiveness. 
{c5}(What happened!? Can you tell me?){/c}
You? Haha.. You seem to be a pretty good fella. You know.. haha.. it's funny.. How could I tell you after all you did for me? Okay... It was five years ago. As I have told you a while ago, I was fighting for Huigronn. I had no fear. I was one of those `Come on, hit me with your best shot' type of person. However, five years ago... things happened. It was a day filled with crowding, screaming, panicking people. The guard next to me started to shout `The Union of Fury has attacked'. Before he ever finished that sentence, a javelin pierced through his heart. I was always ready for combat but after seeing my friend die like that in an instant, I could not move. 
By the time the enemy got to our castle, I was busy cutting down foe after foe. It was then, one of the Union of Fury assassins found me and notched back an arrow. Then... I took a girl who turned the corner, using her as a shield to protect my sorry skin... After that, I saw a quick blur rush the Furies and I was knocked out. When I came to, I awoke beside the enemy, necks broken. I saw an old man crying with that same girl who I killed resting gently in his arms. I regretted being alive. I could not die and I ran before he saw me. I was a coward... I left the army. Everything felt so empty. In a week, I destroyed what I had built all my life. I suffered nightmares every night. I thought the way for redemption is to look for a place to die. That's why I'm wandering the world, giving the sorry excuse of ""helping others""... But you know what? It's tough to just lie down and die for a soldier like me... See, so far I'm alive. Haha... dammit, why am I telling this story near that castle?

Could you tell me about dragon clan's power in return?){/c}
Hmmm, you got a deal! There is no reason to reject your offer since we can avoid combat all together. So. eliminate the monsters and visit us again when you're done. ",,I don't care if you call me a coward for avoiding battle. We just don't like meaningless fights.,

{c5}(Tell me what you know about the dragon clan's power.){/c}
Hmm... To tell you the truth, though we know more than others about this land, we don't know much about the dragons. Maybe it's because we hid from the dragons due to our appearance. I suggest you talk to our elders. I'll send a message to them. However!!! Do me a favor. I sell general goods, right? I have such a pain in my back from these spiders. Please eliminate them for my customers. I'll try to get you the information you want while you kill them. It's trade by barter... Good luck!",,Damn spiders... they're so creepy with their freaky spindly legs and beady little eyes.,

The items that they bore hold the power of the ancient dragon clan. 
You explorers are great. All our elders were surprised. Anyway, thank you on behalf of all our clan. We wanted peace. However, you have reached us first with a helping hand.

You want information on the secret of the dragon clan's power, don't you? Many explorers visit us but die because of the monsters.
